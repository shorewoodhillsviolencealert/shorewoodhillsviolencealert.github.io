            <p class="lead">Cove janitor Paul Vaccaro is a violent biker thug who
                violently attacked Cove resident Sarah Matthews because
                she refused to be his girlfriend so he could live at the Cove.
                He saw her unloading her car in the garage and then stopped
                an elevator and placed a ladder on the floor of the elevator
                hoping she would trip over it. She walked into the open
                elevator with groceries and tripped over the ladder dropping
                everything. He then stood over her as she struggled to get
                up and did not apologize or help her up.</p>
            <p class="lead">Certain female members of the Cove Unit Ownerâ€™s
                Association Board of Directors put their emotional
                friendship with Paul over resident safety and believe he has
                the right to attack and sexually harass residents who refuse
                to let him live in their unit. If Paul is not immeadiately
                terminated for attacking Sarah Matthews and sexually
                harassing Taylor Lee and threatening him with sexual
                violence this flyer will be taken to every house in Shorewood
                Hills so they can learn about the presence of this extremely
                violent individual and his enablers/protectors on the board.</p>
