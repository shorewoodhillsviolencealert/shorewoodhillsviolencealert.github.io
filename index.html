          Cove janitor Paul Vaccaro is a violent biker thug who violently
          attacked Cove resident Sara Matthews because she refused to be his
          girlfriend so he could live at the Cove. He saw her unloading her car
          in the garage and then stopped an elevator and placed a ladder flat on
          the floor of the elevator hoping she would trip over it. She walked
          into the open elevator with groceries and tripped over the ladder
          dropping everything. He then stood over her as she struggled to get up
          and did not apologize or help her up.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Certain members of the Cove Unit Ownerâ€™s Association Board of
          Directors have put their emotional friendship with Paul over resident
          safety and believe he has the right to attack and sexually harass
          residents who refuse to let him live in their unit. If Paul is not
          immediately terminated for attacking Sara Matthews and sexually
          harassing Taylor Lee and threatening him with sexual violence this
          flyer will be taken to every house in Shorewood Hills so they can
          learn about the presence of this extremely violent individual and his
          enablers/protectors on the board.
